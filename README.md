# Mujina
This is a Doki Doki Literature Club fan game that is not affiliated with Team Salvato. It is designed to be played only after the official game has been completed. You can download Doki Doki Literature Club at: http://ddlc.moe

Monika would like to tell you a scary story titled Mujina because she thinks it may interests you. Do you think you'd be surprised by her story?

Things you should know before downloading this game:

- It's free!
- About an hour gameplay!
- 3 endings, but there won't be any choice!
- Contains some spooks!~
- Assets used from Monika After Story, DDLC The Good Ending, and
Wolf & Rabbit!
- Feel free to record your reaction!

## Side Note
The itch.io and Gamejolt page was unlisted due to Dan Salvato's IP guidelines. So, I moved the game to Github for people to access it.
